# ENGR90013-CG-Bowls-Club
## Project Description
Encompassed in that is the selection of players into teams on a weekly basis. This is performed by designated selection committees. They have the task of selecting teams within guidelines such as performance, form, availability, the capability of individuals and groups as well as player strengths, weaknesses and preferences. This is a manual process generally undertaken with magnets containing player names on a magnetic whiteboard. A completely manual process with a heavy reliance on memory and written ad hoc information in relation to each bowler. Having a system of an electronic nature were names of bowlers and their details are contained and maintained as well as being accessible during those selection deliberations would be great.
The client is expecting a software which could readily access all the information required(For example, which aspects are the playerâ€™s strengths and which are the weaknesses), in relation to players and teams, they require in order to have an informed view of player selection.  Making the process of selection more efficient at the same time. Software to help schedule bowls teams taking into account bowlers' performance preferences. In addition, the software may also need to record previous game results.
